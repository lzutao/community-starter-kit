### How you can help

There are many ways you can help us make this project better. Every repository is different and our goal is to create an app that is flexible enough to help most repositories, while still being easy for new app users to grok. If you would like to help, we use labels to organize the work that needs to be done. Look for the labels that fit your expertise:

- **development-needed**: works need to develop in future releases.
- **qa-needed**: works that need to check quality.
- **documentation-needed**: works that need to write documentation.
- **bug-high-priority**: bugs that need to fix in next release.
- **bug-low-priority**: bugs that need to fix in future releases.
- **help-wanted**: works that the author cannot fix, so he/she needs help.

You can also help by translating documentation and reviewing open pull requests.
